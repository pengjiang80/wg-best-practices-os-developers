# Best Practices for Open Source Developers

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions related to the group's mission and charter.

## Objective

Our objective is to provide open source developers with best practices recommendations, and with an easy way to learn and apply them.

Unlike other existing best practices list, we want it to be widely distributed to open source developers and community-sourced. And we want these practices to stick, thanks to an effective learning platform.

## Vision

Our vision is to make it easy for developers to adopt these best practices, thanks to:
- *Identifying* good practices, requirements, and tools that help open source developers create and maintain more secure software
- Helping maintainers *Learn* to write secure software
- Provide tools to help developers *Adopt* these good practices into their daily work

   ## Scope
The Developer Best Practices group wants to help identify and curate an accessible [inventory](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/inventory.md) of best practices
  - Prioritized according to ROI for open source developers
  - Categorized per technology, language, framework
  - Community-curated

Help build a community
  - Program to attract open source contributors and incentivize them to use and contribute to the inventory

Supply a Learning platform
  -Any free course can be integrated into the platform
  - The learner can follow a track, track their progress and get badges
  - A suite of exercises are available for each best practice of the inventory


   ## Current Work
Our work is organized into several discrete-yet-related projects that help us achieve our goals:

- Concise guides for (1) developing software and (2) evaluating OSS (sandbox)
  - [Concise Guide for Developing More Secure Software](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Developing-More-Secure-Software.md#readme)
  - [Concise Guide for Evaluating Open Source Software](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software.md#readme)

- *Common Requirement Enumeration (CRE) Project* - (incubating) https://www.opencre.org/
 
  - Purpose - (Identify) Identify similar requirements in different specifications
- *Secure Software Development Fundamentals* (edX course) - https://openssf.org/training/courses/ and https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals
  - Purpose - (Learn) Teach software developers fundamentals of developing secure software
- *SKF - Security Knowledge Framework* - https://www.securityknowledgeframework.org/ 
  - Purpose - (Identify/Adopt/Learn) Learn to integrate security by design in your web application
- *OpenSSF Best Practices Badge* (formerly CII Best Practices badge) - https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/ and https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge
  - Purpose  - (Identify/Adopt) Identifies FLOSS best practices & implements a badging system for those practices,
- *Scorecards Project* - https://github.com/ossf/scorecard 
  - Purpose - (Adopt) Automate analysis and trust decisions on the security posture of open source projects.
- *Great MFA Distribution Project* - (incubating) https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project
  - Distribute MFA tokens to OSS developers and best practices on how to easily use them
- [Recommended compiler option flags for C/C++ programs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit#heading=h.b3casmpemf1b) (incubating)
  - Recommended compiler option flags for C/C++ programs, especially warning and hardening flags, for developers & distributions
- *Interactive artwork* - (incubating) https://github.com/blabla1337/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/infinity2
  - Place where we want to guide developers in what stage they can use what type of tooling or approach. We have tons of great tools and materials but hard to find for devs, using this page and interactive loop we want to guide them to find the right stuff.
- *Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Existing%20Guidelines%20for%20Developing%20and%20Distributing%20Secure%20Software.md)
   - Purpose - (Identify) - Highlight documentation and training materials that educate OSS developers on good secure coding practices
- *Package Manager Best Practices* - (incubating) - https://github.com/ossf/package-manager-best-practices
   - Purpose - (Identify/Learn) Collect and document security best practices for projects using various package managers.
* [npm Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/ossf/package-manager-best-practices/blob/main/published/npm.md) - This document aims to be a one-time stop explaining the security supply-chain best practices when using npm's package manager.

   ## Related Activities
There are many great projects both within and outside the Foundation that compliment and intersect our work here.  Some other great projects/resources to explore:
- *SLSA Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts* - https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa
   - Purpose - A security framework from source to service, giving anyone working with software a common language for increasing levels of software security and supply chain integrity
